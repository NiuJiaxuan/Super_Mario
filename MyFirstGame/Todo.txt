in the koopatroopa response it will call mario method. should not do that  fix later
else if (touching == CollisionDetector.Touching.left)
                                {
                                    dir = "right";
                                    ShellBump(dir);
                                    mario.TakeDamage();
                                }
                                else if (touching == CollisionDetector.Touching.right)
                                {
                                    dir = "left";
                                    ShellBump(dir);
                                    mario.TakeDamage();
                                }

Should add a new interface called igravity 
entity affected by gravity will inhernent from the igravity
then when checking gravity, just check if it is igravity instead of check the i movable list.
